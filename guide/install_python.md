Installing and running Python
=============================

Python should already be installed and be somewhere on your shell path on your mac. Check the version by running `python --version`. It should be version 2.7.x. If it's less than that, you can upgrade python through processes documented on the internet.

Interactive Shell
-----------------
Running the command `python` with no arguments opens the python interactive shell. The shell accepts all legal python code. It's a good way to experiment with different python features and libraries.

Running Python files
--------------------
To write a program inside a file, simply create a file with the extension '.py'. These files can be run with the `python` command like so: `python test_file.py`
